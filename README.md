A fractal exploration program written in C using the minilibx library.
Features

    Generate and explore Mandelbrot, Julia, and Perpendicular Burning Ship fractals
    Zoom and pan around the fractal using the mouse
    Change the color palette
    Adjust the maximum number of iterations for the fractal calculation

Installation

    Clone this repository to your local machine
    Run make in the root directory of the project to compile the program
    Run ./fractol [fractal] to launch the program, where [fractal] is the name of the fractal you want to explore (e.g. ./fractol mandelbrot)

Usage

Use the following keys to control the program:

    Arrow keys: pan the fractal
    Scroll wheel: zoom in and out of the fractal
    r: reset the view to the default position and zoom level
    c: cycle through the available color palettes
    p and m: increase and decrease the maximum number of iterations for the fractal calculation
